Package for generating a parser for the OWL Abstract Syntax in
http://owl.man.ac.uk/2003/concrete/latest/ producing
OWLOntology objects from the OWL API http://sourceforge.net/projects/owlapi/

The parser depends on a parser generated by ANTLR from grammar/abstract-owl.g.
This is done at precompilation time and put in build/abstractparser/generated.
together with the lexer corresponding to grammar/lexer.g.


### Warning ###

ObjectProperty and DatatypeProperty entities have to be defined 
before they can be used.

Eg:

1. *VALID*
   Namespace(people=<http://cohse.semanticweb.org/ontologies/people#>)
   Ontology( 
     ObjectProperty(people:has_pet)
     Individual(people:fred value(people:has_pet people:felix))
   )

2. *NOT VALID*
   Namespace(people=<http://cohse.semanticweb.org/ontologies/people#>)
   Ontology( 
     Individual(people:fred value(people:has_pet people:felix))
     ObjectProperty(people:has_pet)
   )
   

### Known Bugs ###

	Local names cannot contain either of the following:
		"Deprecated"
		"complete"
		"partial"
		"Symmetric"
		"Functional"
		"InverseFunctional"
		"Transitive"
		"Literal"

   Ontology properties are not processed since there is not 
   a corresponding OWLOntologyProperty in the OWL API.
