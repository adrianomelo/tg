 * Revision 1.2  2006/03/28 16:14:45  ronwalf
 * Merging mindswap changes to OWLApi.
 * Rough summary:
 * * 1.5 compatibility (rename enum variables)
 * * An option to turn on and off importing in OWLConsumer
 * * Bug fix to allow DataRange in more areas
 * * Giving Anonymous individuals an identifier
 *   * New factory method - getAnonOWLIndividual
 *   * getOWLIndividual no longer accepts 'null'
 *   * added getAnonId() and isAnon() to OWLIndividual
 * * Some work on the RDF serializer, but we have a complete rewrite in
 *   Swoop that I think is better (more flexible, results easier to read)
 * * Added Transitive, Functional, InverseFunctional, Inverse, and
 *   Symmetric PropertyAxioms (not sure why, will check)
 * * Added .equals and .hashcode for all OWLObjects
 * * Added a RemoveDataType change
 * * Patches to OntologyImpl for Entity removal
 * * Added OWLIndividualTypeAssertion
 * * Added OWL(Object|Data)Property(Domain|Range)Axiom
