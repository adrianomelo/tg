Classes concerned with validation of OWL ontologies.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>This package contains some basic interface definitions for OWL
species validators. A species validator takes an OWL ontology and
determines the species of OWL that the ontology belongs in. For
example, any ontology which treats classes as instances is an OWL Full
ontology. As another example, any ontology that contains disjoint
class axioms cannot be OWL Lite.
